>**Note!** This view is quite useful in case if you need to attach the names of the used DLT files to your analysis.
>Based on the project's strategy, the analyzed issue might consist of multiple ( up to several dozens ) DLT files, so it is a good manner to specify the one which contains the analyzed use-case.

----

>**Note!** Also, when you work with the multiple DLT files, it is useful to see, in which order the dlt-viewer has parsed them.
>Wrong import order might ruin the chronology of the analyzed logs and make analysis not possible.
>The view allows you to check that aspect, as it prints the files in the same order, in which they were parsed.

## What is the DLTMessageAnalyzer?

The DLTMessageAnalyzer is a plugin for dlt-viewer SW. Works in combination with the **[following source code](https://github.com/GENIVI/dlt-viewer)**

It is developed in order to increase the analytical capabilities of the dlt-viewer.

Feature-set:

- Search speed ten times faster, than in original dlt-viewer, in case of enabled "in-RAM" cache.
- Possibility to save regex patterns with human-readable names
- Possibility to combine saved regex patterns
- "Grouped view" functionality, which allows to easily form groups of repetitive messages and check request-response number, trace spam cases, etc.
- "Search view" functionality. Analogue of the dlt-viewer's search with extended capabilities
- "Files view", which shows names of analyzed files
- Advanced highlighting of regex groups
- Continuous search. The analysis continues to happen while new messages being received from HU 
- Check of entered regular expressions with providing human-readable errors in case of wrong input
- In-RAM cache, which makes search dramatically faster
- Work with multiple regex files. Possibility to copy-paster from one file to the other
and many other features
- "Filters view", which allows to quickly get access to defined "key groups" and change their content
- Regex group names meta-programming
- Lock of the search between 2 message id-s

**=> The main goal of this plugin is to fully replace the existing search functionality of the dlt-viewer, making it faster, more readable, intuitive, and efficient for any user.**
